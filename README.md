# N Body Problem Simulation
This is a Rust implementation of the N Body Problem simulation, which simulates the gravitational interactions between celestial bodies in a 2D space. The simulation uses an iterative approach to update the positions and velocities of the bodies over time. 
### Disclaimer
This is only a model of the N Body Problem. The simulation does not take into account many factors that would be present in a real-world scenario and I do not claim that this is an accurate simulation of the N Body Problem. The simulation is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used for any real-world applications.

## Features

- Simulates the gravitational interactions between celestial bodies in a 2D space.
- Uses an iterative approach to update the positions and velocities of the bodies over time.
- Savable state of the simulation to a file.
- Loadable state of the simulation from a file.
- Pausable simulation.
- Draggable bodies.
- Virtually unlimited number of bodies.
